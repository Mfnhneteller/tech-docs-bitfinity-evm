You can communicate with the Internet Computer Interface for the EVM (Bitfinity) using the following methods:

## DFX CLI

The DFX CLI (Command Line Interface) is a versatile tool allowing direct interaction with the Internet Computer. It facilitates various operations such as deploying, installing, and calling canisters (containerized smart contracts). Moreover, it's instrumental in interfacing with the EVM on Bitfinity.

Check out the [DFX CLI](./dfx-cli) documentation for more information.

## EVM Client

EVM Client is a package that allows you to interact with the EVM (Bitfinity). It is a wrapper around the [JSON-RPC API](../rpc.md) and provides a simple interface for interacting with the EVM via the Canister endpoint.

Check out the [EVM Client](./evm-client) documentation for more information.
