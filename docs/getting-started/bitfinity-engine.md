# Introduction

[The Bitfinity EVM](https://bitfinity.network) is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) built on the
[Internet Computer Protocol](https://internetcomputer.org/),
that provides a solution for developers to deploy their apps on an Ethereum-compatible, high-throughput, scalable and future-safe platform,
with low transaction costs for their users. Besides the EVM, Bitfinity developed the Bitfinity Bridge which allows users to transfer assets between Ethereum, Internet Computer, and Bitfinity.
Bitfinity is backed by top VCs such as Polychain Capital Beacon Fund, ParaFi Capital, Draft Ventures.

Thanks to the Bitfinity EVM, Ethereum native applications can seamlessly be ported to Internet Computer’s L2-like network that is built as a series of canister smart contracts on Internet Computer.
Developers may enjoy familiar Ethereum tooling when working with their Solidity smart contracts on Bitfinity.
The base fee of Bitfinity is the Bitfinity token (BFT), which provides a smooth experience for dapps’ users.

To enhance the Bitfinity EVM, the [Neuro Bridge](https://neurobridge.bitfinity.network/) has been developed, which allows users to transfer assets between Ethereum, Internet Computer, and the Bitfinity Network.
This bridge is built from a canister and the custody of assets is decentralised thanks to Chain-Key technology. 

The features of the Internet Computer Protocol, such as delegated Proof-of-Useful-Work consensus mechanism and
[Chain Key cryptography](https://medium.com/dfinity/chain-key-technology-one-public-key-for-the-internet-computer-6a3644901e28),
allow unprecedented transaction speeds and scalability, decentralised bridging in a fully Ethereum-compatible environment.
