# Overview

The purpose of this tool, which we describe as the evm-archiver, is to reproduce the full state and (optionally full) history of the Bitfinity EVM off-chain.

The `evm-archiver` provides read-only JSON-RPC API access for a full node.

It can  retrieve the bootrstap chain state and history from an another instance of an `evm-archiver`, or directly on-chain from the Bitfinity EVM on the IC, running as an `evm-canister.

In the usage section, we show how to operate an EVM archiver and call its API. The binaries for the EVM archiver can be found here [TBC].
