## Introduction

Block explorer allows accessing the bockchain information from Bitfinity (blocks, transactions, etc) that is updated in real-time.

It is based on the [otterscan](https://github.com/wmitsuda/otterscan) project that targets the custom [erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon) node that continuously gets new information from the Bitfinity.

By using Block Explorer, users and developers can get access to the developer tools and network statistics that provide
extended insights into Bitfinity's EVM.

Users are able to view transactions, addresses, and blocks.
Developers can get a wide range of charts and statistics related to smart contract execution,
collator data, specific transfers between tokens, and a list of ERC-20 tokens on Bitfinity.

## Deploying locally

It is possible to launch a standalone version of the blockchain explorer system that gives and access to the Bitfinity blocks and transactions. Please find the detailed instructions in the [documentation](https://github.com/infinity-swap/erigon/tree/EPROD-178_implement_block_importer/cmd/blockimporter/Readme.md) here.
