[Bitfinity] is a blazingly-fast (1000 TPS+), next-generation EVM, serving as a Layer Two for Bitcoin and other Bitcoin on-chain assets.
With Bitfinity, you will be able to deploy smart-contracts for Bitcoin, Ordinals, BRC-20 - all written in Solidity. 
Bitfinity is built on the Internet Computer.

Layer 2 solutions are ubiquitous in the Ethereum world, and primarily rely on zero-knowledge cryptography or 
optimistic rollups to create secure bridges between the base layer-1 chain and the layer-2. 

Bitfinity instead uses a threshold cryptographic scheme, called Chain-Key, to create a secure decentralised bridge between Bitfinity and 
the Bitcoin blockchain. Chain-key is unique, in that no single node ever has access to the threshold key, the threshold key shares are regenerated on a periodic basis every 11 minutes through "moon-math". 


## Getting Started 

To get started, follow the guide in the getting-started section:
 * connect your wallet to Metamask
 * mint test-net tokens
 * bridge your cross-chain Bitcoin assets to Bitfinity. 

Currently, Bitcoin is supported, but trustless bridges for BRC-20s are in the works. 

* To request some ETH on Bitfinity Testnet, go to [Bitfinity Testnet Faucet](https://bitfinity.network/faucet)
