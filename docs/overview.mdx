# What is the Bitfinity EVM?

[Bitfinity] is a solution, that allows to execute Ethereum contracts in a more performant environment—Internet Computer blockchain, a modern layer-1 blockchain which is fast and scalable.
Bitfinity is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) implemented as a smart contract on [Internet Computer Protocol]. We are here to help scale Ethereum ecosystem for developers to operate their apps on an Ethereum-compatible, high-throughput, scalable, and future-safe platform, with low transaction costs for their users.

Bitfinity provides the Ethereum 1.0 development experience, with layer-2-like speed and scalability. If you are an Ethereum developer, **getting started on the Bitfinity EVM is as easy as changing the RPC endpoint you interact with**.

Bitfinity supports all tools available in the Ethereum ecosystem — [MetaMask], [Truffle], [Hardhat], [Remix], etc.

# Introduction

[Bitfinity](https://bitfinity.network) is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) built on the
[Internet Computer Protocol](https://internetcomputer.org/),
that provides a solution for developers to deploy their apps on an Ethereum-compatible, high-throughput, scalable and future-safe platform,
with low transaction costs for their users. Besides the EVM, Bitfinity developed the Bitfinity Bridge which allows users to transfer assets between Ethereum, Internet Computer, and Bitfinity.
Bitfinity is backed by top VCs such as Polychain Capital Beacon Fund, ParaFi Capital, Draft Ventures.

Thanks to Bitfinity’s EVM, Ethereum native applications can seamlessly be ported to Internet Computer’s L2-like network that is built as a smart contract on Internet Computer.
Developers may enjoy familiar Ethereum tooling when working with their Solidity smart contracts on Bitfinity.
The base fee of Bitfinity is ETH, which provides a smooth experience for dapps’ users.

Besides the Bitfinity, we have developed the Bitfinity Bridge which allows users to transfer assets between Ethereum, Internet Computer, and Bitfinity.
This bridge is built from a canister and the custoy of assets is decentralised thanks to Chain-Key technology. 

The features of the Internet Computer Protocol, such as delegated Proof-of-Useful-Work consensus mechanism and
[Chain Key cryptography](https://medium.com/dfinity/chain-key-technology-one-public-key-for-the-internet-computer-6a3644901e28),
allow unprecedented transaction speeds and scalability, decentralised bridging in a fully Ethereum-compatible environment.
