# Overview

The purpose of this tool is to reproduce state of an EVM canister off-chain and keep it in-sync using Ethereum JSON-RPC API as data source.

The `evm-archiver` provides read-only Ethereum JSON-RPC API too. This allows to use it as data source for another instance of the `evm-archiver`, or just to get `evm-canister` data from off-chain source.
